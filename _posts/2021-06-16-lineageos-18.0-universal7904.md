**LineageOS** is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 9, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.

**LineageOS** is based on the **Android Open Source Project** with extra contributions from many people within the Android community. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. Linked below is a package that has come from another Android project that restore the Google parts. LineageOS does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway.

All the source code for LineageOS is available in the LineageOS Github repo. And if you would like to contribute to LineageOS, please visit out Gerrit Code Review.

### Working features:
* RIL ( Data,SMS,Calls )
* SELinux
* Fingerprint sensor
* WiFi
* Bluetooth
* Camera (All of them on a30 and a40)
* Camcorder
* Audio
* GPS
* Sensors
* Video Playback
* ZRAM
* Internal audio recording
* Face unlock
* Safetynet without magisk 
* Glove Mode (High touch sensitivity)
* Signature spoofing (for MicroG)

### Known issues
* IMS (VoLTE,ViLTE,VoWiFi)
* Extra cameras on m20 and m30

### Reporting Bugs
* Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
* Create new issue [here](https://github.com/SamarV-121/android_device_samsung_universal7904-common/issues).
* Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
* If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
* If the problem disappears after running "setenforce 0" from a root shell, grab /proc/avc_msg.

### Instructions
**Required firmware: Android 10 (OneUI 2.0)**

**If you are coming from stock rom or any custom rom**

1) Boot into any custom recovery

2) Format data

3) Flash latest build

4) Flash gapps package (optional)

5) Reboot your device once the installation is done

**If you are already on LineageOS**

1) Boot into any custom recovery

2) Flash latest build

3) Flash gapps package (optional)

4) Reboot your device once the installation is done

Note: 
1) If you wanna flash from TWRP then you'll have to disable forcedencryption (by flashing this [Disable_forcedencryption patch](https://zackptg5.com/downloads/Disable_Dm-Verity_ForceEncrypt_11.02.2020.zip)) and format data

2) Auto-brightness option doesn't exist on m20 and m30 since both devices doesn't have physical light sensor
on stock rom, they are using camera as light sensor which is quite hacky and comsumes lotta power

3) 5Ghz Wifi band is unsupported in m20
